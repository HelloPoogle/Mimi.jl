# Monte Carlo Simulation support

## @defmcs macro
Monte Carlo Simulations are defined using the macro ```@defmcs```, which does the following:

* Defines random variables (RV) by assigning names to distributions
* Defines how to apply the values generated by each RV to model parameters based on an assignment operator:
  * ```param = RV``` replaces the values in the parameter with the value of the RV for the current trial.
  * ```param += RV``` replaces the values in the parameter with the sum of the original value and the value of the RV for the current trial.
  * ```param *= RV``` replaces the values in the parameter with the product of the original value and the value of the RV for the current trial.
* Defines desired rank correlations between pairs of random variables. Note that these cannot be achieved exactly, but the values are usually fairly close.

The value of the ```@defmcs``` invocation is a ```MonteCarloSimulation``` object, which contains all the definition information in a form that can be applied at run-time.

**Example**

The following example is available in `"Mimi.jl/src/mcs/test_mcs.jl"` in the `dot-overloading` branch.

```julia
using Mimi
using Distributions

include("examples/tutorial/02-two-region-model/main.jl")

m = tworegion.my_model

mcs = @defmcs begin
    # Define random variables. The rv() is required to disambiguate an
    # RV definition name = Dist(args...) from application of a distribution
    # to an external parameter. Naming RVs is required only when defining
    # correlations or sharing a single RV across multiple parameters.
    rv(name1) = Normal(1, 0.2)
    rv(name2) = Uniform(0.75, 1.25)
    rv(name3) = LogNormal(20, 4)

    # define (approximate) rank correlations
    name1:name2 = 0.7
    name1:name3 = 0.5

    # assign RVs to model Parameters
    share = Uniform(0.2, 0.8)
    sigma[:, Region1] *= name2

    sigma[2020:5:2050, (Region2, Region3)] *= Uniform(0.8, 1.2)

    # indicate which parameters to save for each model run. Specify
    # a parameter name or [later] some slice of its data, similar to the
    # assignment of RVs, above.
    save(grosseconomy.K, grosseconomy.YGROSS, 
         emissions.E, emissions.E_Global)
end

# Optional user functions can be called just before or after a trial is run
function print_result(m::Model, mcs::MonteCarloSimulation, trialnum::Int)
    ci = Mimi.compinstance(m.mi, :emissions)
    value = Mimi.get_variable_value(ci, :E_Global)
    println("$(ci.comp_id).E_Global: $value")
end

# Generate trial data for all RVs and (optionally) save to a file
generate_trials!(mcs, 1000, filename="/tmp/trialdata.csv")

# Run trials 1:4, and save results to the indicated directory, one CSV file per RV
run_mcs(m, mcs, 4, output_dir="/tmp/Mimi")

# Same thing but with a post-trial function
run_mcs(m, mcs, 4, post_trial_func=print_result, output_dir="/tmp/Mimi")
```

**The remaining sections describe an API that hasn't been developed yet.**

## ModelRunner

There are several types of analyses that require an ensemble of model runs performed over a set of parameter values. These include traditional Monte Carlo simulation, in which random values are drawn from distributions and applied to model parameters, as well as global sensitivity analyses that use prescribed methods for defining trial data (e.g., Sobol sampling), and Markov Chain Monte Carlo, which computes new trial data based on prior model results.

The abstract type ```ModelRunner``` will be used to define a generic API for model runners, including support for parallelization of analyses on multiprocessors and cluster computing systems. The specific sampling and analysis methods required for each subtype of ```ModelRunner``` will be defined in the concrete subtype, e.g., ```MonteCarloRunner```.

The generic process will look something like this:

```julia
m = ModelDef(...)
r = McsRunner(m)

# Optionally redefine random variables, overriding defaults
setrv!(r, :rvname1, Normal(10, 3))

# Optionally assign an alternative RV or distribution to a model parameter
setparam!(r, :comp1, :param1, :rvname1)
setparam!(r, :comp1, :param2, Uniform(0, 3))

# Adjust what should be saved per model run
@add_results(r, param10, param11[US])
@drop_results(r, param1, param1)

# Run trials 1-5000. Also can specify as a range (e.g., 5001:10000) 
# or vector of trial numbers.
run!(r, 5000)

# Save results to the indicated directory
write(r, dirname)
```

### Saving ensemble results

Ensemble results will be stored in an object of type ```EnsembleResult```, which is used by all subtypes of ```ModelRunner```. By default, only model outputs tagged for output will be saved in the ```EnsembleResult``` instance. Parameters can be identified as "output" parameters in ```@defmcs```, and/or directly in a concrete subtype of ```ModelRunner```, in which case default values set in ```@defmcs``` can be overridden.

The method ```write(r::ModelRunner, dirname::String)``` will save model results to set of CSV files in the named directory. Initially, we will store the data in [tidy](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidyr/vignettes/tidy-data.html) format in which variables are in columns and each row represents an observation. This format is verbose but flexible and commonly used by consumers of data such as plotting packages. Other formats can be generated if the need arises.

In the initial implementation, results will be saved as follows:

* Scalar model results will be written to ```"$dirname/scalars.csv"```. The file will have a column holding the trial number, and one column labeled with each parameter name. Each row in the file will contain all scalar parameter values data for a single  model run. 
  * Example:

    | trialnum | foo | bar | baz | ... |
    | -------- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
    | 1        | 1.6 | 0.4 | 110 | ... |

  * Alternatively, we could flatten to 3 columns: 

    | trialnum | paramname | value |
    | -------- | --------- | ----- |
    | 1        | foo       | 1.6   |
    | 1        | bar       | 0.4   |
    | 1        | baz       | 110   |

* All model results with a single time dimension will be written to ```"$dirname/timeseries.csv"```, with columns:

  | trialnum | year | foo   | bar  | baz  | ... |
  | -------- | ---- | ----- | ---- | ---- | --- |
  | 1        | 2010 | 100.6 | 41.6 | 9.1  | ... |
  | 1        | 2015 | 101.7 | 44.5 | 10.2 | ... |
  | 1        | 2020 | 102.8 | 50.1 | 12.4 | ... |
  | ...      | ...  | ...   | ...  | ...  | ... |
  | 2        | 2010 | 101.6 | 43.7 | 10.4 | ... |
  | 2        | 2015 | 102.4 | 60.1 | 21.3 | ... |
  | 2        | 2020 | 105.7 | 55.3 | 14.2 | ... |
  | ...      | ...  | ...   | ...  | ...  | ... |

  * As with scalar results, this might be flattened further to:

    | trialnum | paramname | year | value |
    | -------- | --------- | ---- | ----- |
    | 1        | foo       | 2010 | 100.6 |
    | 1        | foo       | 2015 | 101.7 |
    | 1        | foo       | 2020 | 102.8 |
    | ...      | ...       | ...  | ...   |
    | 2        | foo       | 2010 | 101.6 |
    | 2        | foo       | 2015 | 102.4 |
    | 2        | foo       | 2020 | 105.7 |
    | ...      | ...       | ...  | ...   |

  * Another alternative would be to store each timeseries result to its own CSV file, in which case the second (flattened) format would be used, minus the "paramname" column, which would be implicit from the filename. This would be more consistent with the matrix format below, since a timeseries result is just a matrix result with only one dimension.

* Matrix results will be saved to individual files named ```"$dirname/$paramname.csv"```. Matrices will be flattened so that each dimension appears as a column. For example, a matrix with dimensions "time" and "region" will have columns "trialnum", 

  | trialnum | region | year | value |
  | -------- | ------ | ---- | ----- |
  | 1 | US | 2010 | 1.1 |
  | 1 | US | 2015 | 1.9 |
  | ...|
  | 1 | CHI | 2010 | 0.2 |
  | 1 | CHI | 2015 | 0.8 |
  | ...|
  
* Another option for saving ensemble outputs might include writing to any "sink" type that accepts named tuples.
